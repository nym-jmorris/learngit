John tries to learn git

John is thoroughly confused. Git on windows, git bash, branches, pull requests, etc, etc. It piles up.

This is also new.... I'm trying something new. Let's see what happens...

Still trying...

Can I commit this to the experiment branch?

Can I delete a previous line?

Look at me, I'm still adding edits and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Still trying...

I can save locally.  A local save is one time thing, just like any other save. There's no historical context.

This is different from committing.  A commit preserves the file in time.  You can create all sorts of commits.

Then, if you're feeling up to it, you can sync to github.  This is what everyone can see.

From there, create a pull request and review with anyone who needs it.

I *think* I'm getting it.
